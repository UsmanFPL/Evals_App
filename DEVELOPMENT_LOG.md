### Technical Decisions
1. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling
2. **Data Validation**: Pydantic v2 with custom validators
3. **Async Support**: Full async/await support for database operations
4. **File Handling**: Secure file uploads with size and type validation
5. **Background Processing**: Celery with Redis for async task processing

### Blockers
- None currently
